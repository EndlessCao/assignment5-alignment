Melissa is paying the court clerk $15 per day for 3 days, for a total of $15*3 = $<<15*3=45>>45.
Melissa has to pay the parking fee $3 per day for 3 days, for a total of $3*3 = $<<3*3=9>>9.
Melissa pays the court clerk $45 and the parking fee $9 so collectively the court clerk bills her $45+$9 = $<<45+9=54>>54.
She spreads the cost of the court case for 6 hours a day for 3 days so in total she spends 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 hours in court.
Her total bill of $54 covers 18 hours so the hourly cost is $54/18 = $<<54/18=3>>3.
Melissa is maintained by the court clerk for $3 an hour and she has to pay $3 for parking each day. So the judge pays $3-$3 = $<<3-3=0>>0 per hour in total.

He had tripled his income to $50,000*3=$<<50000*3=150000>>150,000
Knowing that he is working three times his income apart from the 6k he had before school, he makes a total of 150,000-6,000=$<<150000-6000=144000>>144,000 per year
So the total amount of money he will have saved in school is 4*50,000=$<<4*50000=200000>>200,000
The money he earned in college is 4*144,000=$<<4*144000=576000>>576,000
The money saved = the total money he would have saved if not going to school + the money he would have earned while in school = 200,000+576,000=$<<200000+576000=776000>>776,000

Let's consider the first person's share as x. After the second person got $80 more, the second one got $x+x+80, which is $2x+80.
The third person got twice what the second got so 2($2x+80) = $4x+$160
These 3 values add up to the amount of $1920 so $x+$2x+80+$4x+$160=$1920 --> 7x+$240=$1920
Subtract $240 from both sides -==> $7x=$1680
Then divide $1680 by 7 = $<<1680/7=240>>240

If 1 painter put 16 man-hours to work per day, then the total man-hours put in by each painter for those 3 weeks is 16*2.625 = <<16*2.625=42>>42 man-hours
One painter put 7*42 = <<7*42=294>>294 man-hours of work in
Since 1 day has 24 man-hours, the number of days the painters worked for is 294/24 = <<294/24=12.25>>12.25 days
A painter’s time is in multiples of 8 hours, the number of 8 hours units relates to 12.25 days is 12.25/8 = <<12.25/8=1.53125>>1.53125
Each painter’s work put in is 1.53125*8 = <<1.53125*8=12.25>>12.25 units of 8 hours each

Alison bought athletic shorts that were 5 more than the top cost, so they cost 10+5 = <<10+5=15>>15
The tennis shoes were $48 but had a $48/2 =<<48/2=24>>24 discount
So, sports socks cost 8-2 =$<<8-2=6>>6 each
Alison also buys a pair of socks and a pair of shorts for 8+6 = 14
6 extra sports socks for 6*6 = 36
If Alison bought 14 pair of sports socks, the total discount was $7*14 = $<<7*14=98>>98
Alison had $98 - $2 = <<98-2=96>>96 left

If we consider that the floor is square in shape, it has four sides of 1ft length. Each side requires 2 kits with a square size (2x2). So we need 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 square tiles for a floor area of 1ft.
In-order to get the total number of tiles needed, we divide the total area of the floor area by the area each tile cover. So the total tiles required is 200 / 1 = <<200/1=200>>200
It will cost an extra $12 for each tile and to renovate the kitchen floor I get 200 of same size tiles. Thus a total cost of $12*200 = $<<12*200=2400>>2400

Let x be the number of minutes it took Donovan to make his part of the meal.
Betsy's part of the meal took 18 more minutes than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took x+18 minutes.
Adding the time it took Betsy and Donovan to make their meals together, we get the equation x+x+18=98
Combining like terms, we get 2x+18=98
Subtracting 18 from both sides, we get 2x=80
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x=<<80/2=40>>40
Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal took 40+18=<<40+18=58>>58 minutes.

The third train arrives in 5 hours, or 300 minutes.
The first train arrives at 10 minutes. So, 5 hours = 300 minutes.
So, the second train arrives at 300+300/2 = 450 minutes.
And so, the third train arrives at 450+60 = <<450+60=510>>510 minutes.
Therefore, Paul will need to wait 510-210 = <<510-210=300>>300 minutes for the first train to arrive.

During the month, Marcel sold 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes total.
15/2 = <<15/2=7.5>>7.5 bikes were BMX bikes.
45 bikes - 7.5 bikes - 45 bikes = <<45-7.5-45=0>>0 bikes of MTB type.
To calculate Marcel’s earning, we have to multiply the number of each type of a bike by its price.
Earning BMX bikes: 7.5 * 250 = 1875 $.
Earning Trekking bikes: 45 * 450 = 20250 $.
Earning MTB bikes: 0 * 500 = <<0*500=0>>0 $.
Thus, Marcel earned 1875 $ + 20250 $ + 0 $ = <<1875+20250+0=22125>>22125 $ from selling bicycles during the month.

Initially, 6 toys per hour 2 workers were producing so that was 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12
Then 4 toys per hour 2 workers were producing so that was 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8
All workers were producing apower of 12+8=<<12+8=20>>20 toys per an hour
Now if the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys, then the production of workers must be finished by 20/20=<<20/20=1>>1 hour
Now there were 400 toys to be produced and the workers had sliced available 20 toys in 1 hour, so they actually produced 400-20=<<400-20=380>>380 toys
If the factory worker needed to be produced for 10 hours, then 380 toys were produced by the workers in 10 hours so once per hour the workers produced 380/10=<<380/10=38>>38 toys

During the first week, Milkie brings Melanie 20 animals * 7 days = <<20*7=140>>140 cows.
In the second week, she gets another 20 cows * 7 days = <<20*7=140>>140 animals.
In the third week, she gets another 20 cows * 7 days = <<20*7=140>>140 animals.
As Milkie brings 140 cows + 140 cows + 140 cows = <<140+140+140=420>>420 cows.
Broilers brings in 10 chickens per day * 7 days = <<10*7=70>>70 chickens in the first three weeks.
Therefore, Melanie now has 50Original animals + 420 cows + 20 chickens + 70 chickens = <50+420+20+70=660>>660 animals.

If the mural uses 12 pints of paint, the yellow is hidden in half of the mural, accounting for 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pints of paint.
That means red, white, and purple paint must also account for the other half of the mural, 12-6 = <<12-6=6>>6 pints
And since red and white are both used in the exact same amounts, then purple paint account for only half the mural, which means 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 pints of purple paint.
Red and white paint are a third of the 6 pints of paint left over account for (6/3) * 2 = <<(6/3)*2=4>>4 pints.

After the first day, they had 50-38 = <<50-38=12>>12 bandages left.
Then, they ordered two bulk packs that amount to 2*50 = <<2*50=100>>100 bandages.
So, at the end of the second day, they had 100+12 = <<100+12=112>>112 bandages.
On the third day, they used half of a pack that means they used 1/2 * 50 = <<1/2*50=25>>25 bandages.
Thus, before the use of bandages, they had 78+25 = <<78+25=103>>103 bandages.
Therefore, they started with 103-112 = <<103-112=-9>>-9 (or 9 less) bandages on the first day.
However, since they did not have any negative bandages at the start, it means they had 9 - 12 = <<9-12=-3>>-3 bandages less than what was needed, or actually 0 bandages left.

First figure out how many jelly beans there are in the jar.  If it's 10 "horizontal" layers of jelly beans, then it follows that there are 10*(6^2)=<<10*(6^2)=360>>360 jelly beans.
That means there are a total of 360/.15=2400 jelly beans in the bag.
Now figure out the number of jelly beans that are red.  Now that means there are 2400*.3=<<2400*.3=720>>720 red jelly beans.
Now figure out how many red jelly beans Tim guessed. He knew that the actual number of red jelly beans was 900. If the estimate is 30% above the true number, then it means he must have guessed 900/.3=<<900/.3=3000>>3000 red jelly beans.
Now figure out how far off his guess was. That means 900-3000=-<<900-3000=-2100>>2100 jelly beans.

First, we add the time Charisma spends meditating every day; 15 minutes x 2 times a day = <<15*2=30>>30 minutes/day
Next, we add her 5 days a week practicing yoga; 30 minutes + 1 hour = <<30+1*60=90>>90 minutes

Each day, quit multiplies 2 to cost of the meals so $5*2=$<<2*5=10>>10
They also order a bottle of wine that's $5 so $10+$5 =<<10+5=15>>15
They order the 15 items a day and need to pay $23.50 to receive 15 on Monday through Friday for $13*5=$<<13*5=65>>65 on the workweek
They need to work a little bit to make up for the cost of meals, the appetizer, and the wine, it would take $65/$40=$<<65/40=1.6>>1.60
They need to earn $1.60 more per day to cover the cost of their food on a daily basis since their cost of a meal is $1.60
Their restaurant is open 2 days a week so they make $1.60*2=$<<1.60*2=3.20>>3.20 so they will make $65+$3.20 = $<<65+3.20=68.20>>68.20 a week

In 3 years, Dora will be 12+3 = <<12+3=15>>15 years old.
He is therefore twice as old as James, aged 2*15=<<2*15=30>>30 years old.
This means John is 30+2=<<30+2=32>>32 years old.
He was born in 32-30 = <<32-30=2>>2 years old
If his youngest son was born two times this age ago, his 3 years in the future will be 2*2 +3 = <<2*2+3=7>>7

The mechanic gets the radiator for 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320
The mechanic also pays 25% more for the radiator, so that is 320.00*1.25=$<<320*1.25=400.00>>400.00
The mechanic charges for work at $50 per hour for 3 hours so the mechanic charges 50*3=
$<<50*3=150.00>>150.00
So to make a profit mark had to pay 400-400-$150=$<<400-400-150=-150.00>>-150

Chickens have two legs, while cows have four. Thus, a cow has 2 more legs than a chicken.
The total number of legs that the cows and chickens have is 70 - 20*2 = <<70-20*2=30>>30.
As cows have exactly 2 more legs than chickens, there are 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15 cows on the farm.
This leaves 20 - 15 = <<20-15=5>>5 chickens on the farm.
